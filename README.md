## What is Labour Today ##
Labour Today is an on demand app that connects contractors to part time general and skilled labourers. 
The app allows a contractor to sign up or login and enter the time, date and location of the worker desired. 
Also the contractor can input specific details of the desired worker. 
The worker will receive a notification with the details of the job. 
The worker can respond within the app to accept or decline the job. 
The contractor will receive a confirmation notification notifying him that a worker has been found. 
At the end of the day the worker is rated and totals hours worked are inputted and the cost is calculated. 
Through using stripe the payment is accepted and processed.

The app is currently going through a complete redesign/revamp and will not be usable. 
The Labour Today team is working to improve your experience. Please stay tuned for announcements!
